Suction Cup Sticking to Surfaces
========

How long does the suction cup on a pencil sharpener stick to various
surfaces in my extra bedroom? A morning science project by me and my
kid. We did at least two replicates for each surface. Time is measured
in seconds.

- Corner shelf is real wood.
- Desk top is manufactured wood with textured lamination.
- Floor is a hardwood floor.
- Mat is a textured plastic mat for an office chair.
